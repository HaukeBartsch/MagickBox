MagickBox - Processing MRI Data
===============================

MagickBox is an environment for data processing. It is usually deployed as a virtual machine and provides processing pipelines for medical image analysis such as gradient unwarp, bias field corrections, and the PING processing pipeline. Limited documentation is available on http://magickbox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.

Data is received by DICOM Send from a modality station, PACS, or OsiriX, processed on this box and resulting volumes are send back again.
