MagickBox
=========

This documentation is a work in progress. All functionality described is still experimental.

The MagickBox computer system executes processing tasks on data. Data is send to the system which reacts by performing an operation on the data optionally followed by a reply to the sender. Because of its simplicity it integrates well into existing institutions with large data processing needs. As a primary use case MagickBox was developed to facilitate image processing in a research hospital environment by supporting DICOM send/receive operations as well as distributed computations of large numbers of image studies in a heterogeneous compute environment.
